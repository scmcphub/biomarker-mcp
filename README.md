# biomarker-MCP

Natural language interface for celltype marker query through MCP.

## 🪩 What can it do?

- query celltype marker from CellMarker database by natural language
- will add more database

## ❓ Who is this for?

- Anyone who wants to do query celltype marker with natural language!
- Agent developers who want to query cell markers for their applications

## 🌐 Where to use it?

You can use biomarker-mcp in most AI clients, plugins, or agent frameworks that support the MCP:

- AI clients, like Cherry Studio
- Plugins, like Cline
- Agent frameworks, like Agno 

## 🎬 Demo

A demo showing scRNA-Seq cell cluster analysis in a AI client Cherry Studio using natural language based on biomarker-mcp

## 🏎️ Quickstart

### Install

Install from PyPI
```
pip install biomarker-mcp
```
you can test it by running
```
biomarker-mcp run
```


#### run biomarker-mcp locally
Refer to the following configuration in your MCP client:

check path
```
$ which biomarker 
/home/test/bin/biomarker-mcp
```

```
"mcpServers": {
  "biomarker-mcp": {
    "command": "/home/test/bin/biomarker-mcp",
    "args": [
      "run"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### run biomarker-server remotely
Refer to the following configuration in your MCP client:

run it in your server
```
biomarker-mcp run --transport shttp --port 8000
```

Then configure your MCP client in local AI client, like this:
```

"mcpServers": {
  "biomarker-mcp": {
    "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp"
  }
}
```
